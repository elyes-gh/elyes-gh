# 👋 Hi, I'm Elyes

Software engineer based in Paris 🇫🇷

I enjoy writing code in general — backend, frontend, tooling, small experiments —  
anything that helps me understand how systems work and how to make them better.

I’m curious by nature and I like going a bit deeper than “it works”.

## 🧠 How I approach coding

What I care about most is:
- writing code that is **clear and maintainable**
- understanding **why things behave the way they do**
- improving existing code rather than rewriting everything
- balancing simplicity, performance and readability

I like exploring problems from different angles, whether it’s on the frontend, the backend, or somewhere in between.

## 🛠 What you’ll find here

Most of my professional work lives in **private repositories**.

On this GitHub, you’ll mainly find:
- personal projects
- experiments and proofs of concept
- small tools and side ideas
- notes and documentation

This space reflects how I learn, test ideas, and improve over time.

## 💬 About discussions

I enjoy talking about:
- code structure and trade-offs
- performance vs simplicity
- frontend vs backend responsibilities
- lessons learned from real-world projects

If you’re curious about how I think or how I solve problems, feel free to reach out.
